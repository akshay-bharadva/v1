## ⚙️ Local Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshay-bharadva/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Supabase Setup

This project is tightly integrated with Supabase. You'll need a free Supabase account.

1.  **Create a Supabase Project:**
    *   Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project.
    *   Once created, navigate to **Project Settings** > **API**.
    *   Find your **Project URL** and **`anon`, `public` key**.

2.  **Create Environment File:**
    *   In the root of the project, create a new file named `.env`.
    *   Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if provided) or add the following, replacing the values with your Supabase credentials:

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_PUBLIC_KEY
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BUCKET_NAME=blog-assets
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:8888
    ```

3.  **Run SQL Setup Scripts:**
    *   Navigate to the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard.
    *   Click **+ New query**.
    *   Copy the entire SQL script from the `supabase.md` file in this repository and paste it into the SQL editor.
    *   Click **Run**. This will create all the necessary tables, policies (RLS), triggers, and functions.

4.  **Create Storage Bucket:**
    *   Navigate to **Storage** in your Supabase dashboard.
    *   Click **Create a new bucket**.
    *   Enter the bucket name you defined in your `.env` file (e.g., `blog-assets`).
    *   Toggle **Public bucket** to ON.
    *   Click **Create bucket**. The RLS policies from the SQL script will automatically apply.

5.  **Enable MFA:**
    *   Navigate to **Authentication** > **Settings** > **MFA**.
    *   Enable **TOTP**.

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8888`.

---

## 🔑 Accessing the Admin Panel

1.  **Navigate to the Login Page:** Go to `http://localhost:8888/admin/login`.
2.  **Create Your Admin Account:** Since this is a new setup, you don't have a user yet. **Use the sign-up form on the login page** to create your admin account. Supabase will send a confirmation email.
3.  **Confirm Your Email:** Click the link in the confirmation email.
4.  **First Login & MFA Setup:**
    *   Log in again with your new credentials.
    *   You will be automatically redirected to the MFA setup page (`/admin/setup-mfa`).
    *   Scan the QR code with your authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy).
    *   Enter the 6-digit code to verify and complete the setup.
    *   You will be redirected to the admin dashboard.
5.  **Subsequent Logins:** For all future logins, you will be prompted to enter an MFA code after your password.

## 🚀 Deployment to GitHub Pages

This guide explains how to deploy the portfolio as a static site to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

### 1. Configure `next.config.js`

Ensure your `next.config.js` is set up for static export. The following settings are required:

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  trailingSlash: true, // Important for GitHub Pages routing
  images: {
    unoptimized: true, // Required for next/export
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

### 2. Add Environment Variables to GitHub

To allow GitHub Actions to build your site, you must add your Supabase credentials as repository secrets.

1.  Go to your GitHub repository.
2.  Click on **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
3.  Click **New repository secret** for each of the following variables from your `.env` file:
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUCKET_NAME`
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (Set this to your public GitHub Pages URL, e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name`)

### 3. Create the GitHub Actions Workflow

1.  In your repository, create a directory path: `.github/workflows/`.
2.  Inside `workflows`, create a new file named `deploy.yml`.
3.  Paste the following code into `deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy Next.js site to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### 4. Enable GitHub Pages

After you push these changes to your `main` branch, the deployment action will run for the first time.

1.  Wait for the `Deploy Next.js site to Pages` action to complete successfully.
2.  In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
3.  Under **Build and deployment**, set the **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
4.  GitHub will automatically detect the artifact and deploy it.

Your site will be deployed and available at the URL shown on the Pages settings page.

Ideas for new functionalities and enhancements:

**I. Enhancing User Experience & Engagement (Public Site):**

1.  **Global Navigation & Footer:**

    - **Functionality:** A consistent header with links (Home/Portfolio, Blog, About, Contact) and a simple footer (copyright, social links).
    - **Neo-Brutalist Style:** Stark, fixed or sticky header with bold typography and bordered links. Footer can be minimal.
    - **Benefit:** Improved site navigation and a more complete feel.

2.  **Advanced Blog Features:**

    - **Search Functionality:** Allow users to search blog posts.
      - _Implementation:_ Supabase full-text search or client-side filtering for smaller blogs.
    - **Filtering by Tags:** Clickable tags on blog posts that filter the blog index page.
    - **Related Posts:** Suggest 2-3 related posts at the end of an article (based on tags or simple heuristics).
    - **Comments Section:**
      - _Implementation:_ Supabase table for comments, RLS for security, moderation in admin.
      - _UI:_ Simple, stark comment form and display.
    - **Social Sharing Buttons:** For easily sharing posts.
      - _UI:_ Custom-styled buttons matching the Neo-Brutalist theme rather than default social media buttons.

3.  **Interactive Portfolio Elements:**

    - **Filtering Portfolio Items:** By tags or type (if you add types to portfolio items).
    - **Lightbox/Modal for Images:** If portfolio items have multiple images, a simple, stark modal to view them larger.
    - **"View Case Study" Links:** For portfolio items that might have a more detailed blog post write-up.

4.  **"About Me" Page:**

    - **Functionality:** A dedicated page to share your story, skills, and experience.
    - **Content:** Could be managed via a special "singleton" section in the Content Manager or a dedicated Markdown file.

5.  **Contact Form:**

    - **Functionality:** Allow visitors to send you messages.
    - **Implementation:**
      - Supabase Edge Function to handle form submission and send an email (e.g., via Resend, SendGrid).
      - Store messages in a Supabase table for viewing in the admin.
    - **UI:** Clean, functional form with clear error/success states.

6.  **Accessibility (A11y) Enhancements:**
    - **Focus States:** Ensure all interactive elements have highly visible focus states (often a thicker border or inverted colors in Neo-Brutalism).
    - **Semantic HTML:** Continue using appropriate tags.
    - **ARIA Attributes:** Add where necessary for complex components.
    - **Color Contrast:** Double-check critical text/background contrasts.

**II. Improving Admin Experience & Functionality:**

1.  **Dashboard Enhancements:**

    - **Quick Stats:** Number of posts, drafts, total views, portfolio items, etc.
    - **Recent Activity:** (e.g., last 5 edited posts).
    - **"Quick Create" Buttons:** Directly on the dashboard.

2.  **Advanced Content Management:**

    - **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** For portfolio sections and items within sections (update `display_order` in Supabase). Could also apply to blog post ordering if desired (though date is common).
    - **Bulk Actions for Blog Posts:** Select multiple posts to publish, unpublish, or delete.
    - **Image Management/Media Library (Advanced):**
      - A dedicated section in the admin to view all uploaded images in Supabase Storage, delete unused ones, see where they are used. This is a larger feature.
    - **Internal Notes for Posts/Items:** A field in the admin only, not public, for your own reminders.

3.  **Security Settings (Supabase MFA Focused):**

    - **Factor Management:** The current `security-settings.tsx` allows removing factors. You could expand this to show factor names, last used, etc., more clearly if Supabase JS client provides that.
    - **Password Change:** Implement a secure password change flow using Supabase auth methods.
    - **Session Management (if API supports):** List active sessions and allow revoking them. (Supabase currently doesn't expose this directly via client SDK for all sessions, but you could log sign-ins).

4.  **Markdown Editor Enhancements:**
    - **Custom Toolbar Buttons:** For inserting common custom components or snippets (e.g., a "call to action" block).
    - **Better List Handling in Preview:** The simple Markdown-to-HTML converter might need more robust list parsing.

**III. Technical & SEO Enhancements:**

1.  **Sitemap Generation (`sitemap.xml`):**

    - **Functionality:** Dynamically generate a sitemap for search engines.
    - **Implementation:** Create an API route in Next.js that queries Supabase for published blog posts and portfolio section URLs.

2.  **RSS Feed for Blog (`/feed.xml`):**

    - **Functionality:** Allow users to subscribe to your blog via RSS.
    - **Implementation:** Similar to sitemap, an API route generating an XML feed.

3.  **Structured Data (JSON-LD):**

    - **Functionality:** Add structured data to blog posts (`Article`) and potentially portfolio items (`CreativeWork`) to improve SEO.
    - **Implementation:** Embed JSON-LD scripts in the `<Head>` of relevant pages.

4.  **Open Graph & Twitter Card Refinements:**

    - Ensure all relevant pages (blog posts, portfolio) have comprehensive OG and Twitter tags, especially images.

5.  **Performance Monitoring:**
    - Integrate Vercel Analytics (if deploying on Vercel) or a simple analytics solution like Plausible/Umami.

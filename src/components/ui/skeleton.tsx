/*
This file is updated for the new kinetic typography design system.
- The neo-brutalist `border-2 border-black` and `rounded-none` are removed.
- The skeleton now uses `rounded-md` for consistency with other components.
- The background color is updated to use the theme's `muted` color for a subtle, modern placeholder effect that works in both light and dark themes.

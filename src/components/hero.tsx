Heya! I'm a full-stack developer and life-long learner from
India, currently living in ON, Canada. I enjoy learning new
technologies and collaborating with other developers to make products
a reality. I also enjoy open-source; despite having a full-time job, I
devote time to exploring open-source projects and studying their tech
stack and coding conventions.

Fun but sad fact: I often misspell the return keyword (e.g.,{" "}
<span className="rounded-none border border-black bg-yellow-200 px-1 py-0.5 font-bold text-indigo-700">
‚Äúreutrn‚Äù
</span>
). Let me know if you have any tricks to avoid this mistake! (P.S.
Thanks to linters for preventing me from breaking deployment pipelines
